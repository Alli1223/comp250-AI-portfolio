\section{Overall Concept}
Integration into comp150 game.
Kind of like the Sims AI but less player controlled.

The ship will have facilities that the agents can use.

An AI that will control agents in the game, these agents will have needs that they will have to seek out when they go below a set threshold.

Could look into some sort of AI that will 


\section{Functionality}
My plan is to modify the comp150 game to be a spaceship, and within this ship there will be characters that will have needs such as:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Hunger
  \item Sleep
  \item Health
  \item Toilet
\end{itemize}

Extra stretch goals:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Stress
	\item Comfort
	\item Happiness
\end{itemize}

\section{Key Requirements}

A* Pathfinding.

Some sort of behavior/decision tree?

A fair bit of modification to the current game to optimize and simplify the engine for lots of agents, and strip out any of the unused functionality in the game.
